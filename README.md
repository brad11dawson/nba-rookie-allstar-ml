Implements several ml methods to try to predict if an NBA rookie will become an allstar.

The models implemented were a decision tree, a gradient boosted machine, and a random forest. The best results come from the Gradiant boosted machine. The models include the scripts to read the data, prepare the data, train the data, and test the data.
